# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview

This project uses javascript, d3 and HTML to analyse the  belly button biodiversity of various volunteers who participated in a study. The html page is published via github. The webpage contains three dynamic charts,

- a bar chart for "Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found"
- a gauge chart for "Belly Button Washing Frequency"
- a bubble chart for "Bacteria Cultures per Sample"

The dropdown menu will list the ID numbers of all the volunteers.When a volunteer ID is chosen from the dropdown menu, that person's demographics information, such as location, sex, and age, will be displayed and the charts are updated to display the analytics for the volunteer.
